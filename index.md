Fiber optics for difficult environments

Digitization is also gaining ground in tunneling and mining projects. Given the adversity of these environments, the requirements are very high. Large distances, together with the need for bandwidth, make the fiber optic cable for difficult environments the indispensable driver for industrial Ethernet.

For these reasons, HARTING has developed a solution for these applications in extreme conditions, where the optical interfaces are very sensitive to contamination.

Expanded Beam Cable Assembly by HARTING offers an alternative in which the fiber is "protected" by the connector and, consequently, is not affected by the presence of dirt, water or other elements.

In addition, with this solution, the disconnection of the wiring is less problematic than in other fiber optic cables. Even if the length of the optical connection is extended, it is not a complication either, since an additional cable can be connected easily, without needing to pay attention to the direction of distribution. In this way, customers save time and money.

Where to use fiber optics for difficult environments
Now a days many [Cable internet companies](https://www.fieldengineer.com/blogs/observations-solutions-cables-companies/)are available in market.The new HARTING solution is applicable in places exposed to adverse conditions, where standard optical connectors can not guarantee the required reliability and, until now, access to FOC was difficult.

The excavation of tunnels and mining are just two examples of the use of this optical fiber for difficult environments. Expanded Beam Cable Assembly can also be adopted when linking networks in construction of platforms or container ports.
PROFIBUS repeater by optical fiber

Belden announces a new version of its PROFIBUS fiber optic repeater. Called OZD Profi 12M G22, it allows PROFIBUS networks to communicate over longer distances by means of fast and reliable fiber optic signals, while guaranteeing signal quality thanks to integrated redundancy technology.

This new device is based on Hirschmann's family of PROFIBUS repeaters, with proven quality and excellent signal conversion capacity.

Characteristics of the new PROFIBUS repeater by optical fiber

Enhanced capabilities of this repeater include the following:

Longer operating distances for PROFIBUS communications thanks to two electrical ports and two optical ports.
Communications in safe mode with built-in ring redundancy, without measurable interruptions (ie, within 0 milliseconds).
Higher data integrity despite difficult environments, protected by a robust metal casing with protective coating on internal components.
High speed data transmissions, up to 12 Mbps, among the fastest in the industry.
Compatible with single mode, multiple mode and plastic fiber.
It is ideal for real-time control networks that extend over long distances, for example in energy applications, such as gas or oil production or in gas pipelines or pipelines, and in the transportation industry, such as control systems of traffic on roads. Other uses include water and wastewater systems, and manufacturing systems that require large PROFIBUS communication networks that are reliable and safe
